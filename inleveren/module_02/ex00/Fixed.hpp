//The Orthodox Canonical Class Form (OCCF):

//Default Constructor:
//The purpose of a constructor is to properly create new objects. A default constructor is one that can be called with no arguments. A default constructor can declare parameters but each constructor parameter must have a default value so the constructor can be called without arguments.

//Destructor:
//The purpose of the destructor is to properly tear down objects when they are no longer needed and release any resources reserved for the objectâ€™s use during its lifetime.

//Copy Constructor:
//The purpose of a copy constructor is to create new objects from existing objects. The copy constructor will declare at least one parameter that is a reference type to which the copy constructor belongs.

//Copy Assignment Operator:
//The purpose of a copy assignment operator is to initialize an existing object to the values supplied by another existing object.
